Data structures and naming conventions
======================================
This list only includes data types that don't have their own classes.

`img`:
  A `np.ndarray` that contains the voxelized scene.

`atoms`:
  A `pandas.DataFrame` with the following columns: x, y, z, element.  This is 
  the way atoms are expected to be represented externally.  Internally, the 
  Atom data class is used to represent individual atoms.

`voxel`:
  A 3D `numpy.ndarray` containing the index for one of the cells in the image.  
  Generally, these indices are constrained to actually fall within the image in 
  question (i.e. no indices greater than the size of the image or less than 0).  
  Note that a `grid` object is needed to determine the physical location of the 
  voxel.  When multiple voxels are involved, the array has dimensions of (N,3).

`coords`:
  A 3D `numpy.ndarray` containing the location of the center of a voxel in 
  real-world coordinates, in units of Angstroms.  When multiple coordinates 
  that involved, the array has dimensions of (N,3).
"""

@dataclass
class ImageParams:
    """\
    A collection of parameters that apply to the image as a whole, as opposed
    to individual atoms.

    The most important parameters are `channels` and `grid`.  Together, these 
    specify the dimensions of the image.  The remaining parameters have 
    reasonable defaults.
    """

    channels: int
    """\
    The number of channels in the image.

    Note that this must be consistent with the *channels* column of the *atoms* 
    data frame passed to `image_from_atoms()`.  An error will be raised if any 
    atoms have channel indices that exceed the actual number of channels, or 
    are negative.

    The data type used to encode each voxel of the image.

    The following data types are supported:

    - `np.float32`, a.k.a. `np.single`
    - `np.float64`, a.k.a. `np.double`

    Note that 64-bit (i.e. double-precision) floating point numbers are always 
    used for the intermediate calculations needed to fill in each voxel.  
    According to the overlap_ library, which implements most of these 
    calculations, "reducing the numerical precision of the scalar floating 
    point type will have a significant impact on the precision and stability of 
    the calculations".  Therefore, this setting only affects the precision used

    The main reason to use this function is to more efficiently assign 
    channels, and sometimes radii, to each atom.  It would be possible to 
    assign both these properties before calling `image_from_atoms()`, but that 
    would mean processing the whole *atoms* dataframe.  Most of the time, only 
    a small fraction of those atoms will end up in the final image, so 
    processing all of them is a waste of time.  In contrast, this function is 
    called after an initial filtering step removes irrelevant atoms.

    This function should never modify any values that were used in the 
    filtering step itself.  Doing so would likely cause the results of the 
    filtering step to be incorrect.  This always includes the *x*, *y*, and *z*

    reason to specify this parameter is to allow *radius_A* to be calculated by 
    `process_filtered_atoms()`, which can be more efficient.  Note that an error

              create this column, if necessary.
